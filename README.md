# 🧠 Eonra – Brain-Inspired Reasoning System

Eonra is a logic-driven AI assistant built using Python and Streamlit.  
It simulates how a human might reason through a question step by step — with clear logic tracing, memory, and follow-up suggestions.

## 🚀 Features (v0.5)

- ✅ Accepts open-ended questions
- 🧠 Detects keywords and simulates reasoning
- 🔁 Remembers the last topic and recent questions
- 🧹 Clear Memory button to reset session
- 💬 Feedback buttons (👍 / 👎) to simulate learning
- 💡 Starter buttons for users who don’t know what to ask
- 🧾 Smart Session Summary of what you explored
- 🔄 Suggests related topics to continue the conversation

## 💡 Why I Built This

I'm currently learning Python, AI, and real-world software development.  
Eonra started as a personal learning project to practice:
- Programming with Python
- Web apps with Streamlit
- Logic design and user experience
- Building AI-style behavior without using an actual model

This project continues to evolve — and I’m learning by building.
