# Eonra â€“ Brain-Inspired AI Reasoning System

Eonra is a logic-driven AI assistant that simulates how the human brain reasons, recalls, and responds. It combines structured topic recognition with fallback support using OpenAI's GPT API for open-ended queries.

This project was built as a portfolio-grade MVP to demonstrate practical skills in Python development, AI integration, and product thinking.

## Features

- Logic-based keyword reasoning system
- Short-term memory to track recent user questions
- Intelligent follow-up suggestions based on context
- Fallback to GPT-3.5-turbo for unmatched queries
- Starter prompts and session summaries
- Clear feedback interface (helpful / not helpful)
- Secrets management using Streamlit configuration
- One-click session reset (Clear Memory)

## Why I Built This

This project was designed to go beyond a standard chatbot. Eonra is a blend of traditional logic and generative AI, structured to mimic real cognitive behavior and guide users toward deeper learning and better answers.

It was also my way of learning and applying:
- Python and Streamlit
- API integration (OpenAI)
- Version control (Git/GitHub)
- Application structure and memory handling
- Clean UI and user flow

---

## Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Streamlit
- OpenAI GPT API (v1.0 SDK)
- Git and GitHub

---

## Future Plans

- Long-term conversation memory
- User authentication and personal context
- Deployment as a SaaS application
- Customizable GPT keys per user

---

## Disclaimer

This app uses the OpenAI API under my developer key and is subject to rate limits or cost controls. GPT responses are AI-generated and should not be taken as professional advice.
