## 💡 Why I Built This

I'm currently learning Python, AI, and real-world software development.  
Eonra started as a personal learning project to practice:
- Programming with Python
- Building apps with Streamlit
- Creating logic systems
- Thinking like an AI developer

I’m continuing to expand Eonra week by week — this is just the beginning!
